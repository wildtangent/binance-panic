# Binance Panic

In case you want to dump all your coins to TETHER (Crash under way).

*Now don't be fucking stupid.*

* The API and front end are unprotected.
* Don't deploy this shit or put it anywhere unsafe.
* With your API Key and secret someone can do anything to your Binance account, without authenticating or 2FA.
